# The-Vault

Evaluation
​
* __Project Workflow__: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program you’re in (detailed above)?
​
* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?
​
* __Creativity__: Did you added a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not just a login button and an index page)?
​
* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors as we have in class?
​
* __Problem Solving__: Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrated that you thought through alternative implementations? _(Note that this part of your feedback evaluation will take place during your one-on-one code review with your instructors, after you've completed the project.)_



Challenges:
This is our first group project in GA. There are 3-4 people in one group. We started with 4 teammates. But half-way in our project, 2 of them were seriously ill, so the rest of us had to complete our project within the deadline. It was good turnout but there are a lot of work needs to be polished at the end. I have continued working on this project during the holidays. Have added new features and new techs, eg. Tachyons and Material.UI.

Wins:
Created the basic backend within 2 working days
Got a high-level understanding of how  backend and frontend working together
Used different React library/framework for the APP
Restyled the CSS style from Bulma to Tachyons
